# Rate Limiting — `/auth/login`

Documentation for the brute-force and DoS protection implemented on the login endpoint. Combines two complementary mechanisms: rate limiting by IP (nginx) and rate limiting by account (backend + Redis).

## Why two mechanisms

A single mechanism doesn't cover every scenario:

- **IP-only** protects against a single attacker, but not against a botnet (many IPs, one attempt each, all targeting the same account) — no individual IP ever exceeds the limit.
- **Account-only** protects against the botnet, but doesn't distinguish "many legitimate users behind the same IP" (NAT, e.g. a university network) from an attacker — combined incorrectly, it can unfairly lock out legitimate users, and on its own it doesn't throttle raw traffic against the server.

Together, they cover each other's blind spots.

## 1. Rate limit by IP (nginx)

**File:** `nginx/template/default.conf.template`

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=login:10m rate=10r/m;

# inside the SSL server{} block:
location /auth/login {
    proxy_pass http://backend:8000;
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    limit_req zone=login burst=5 nodelay;
}
```

- **Key:** source IP (`$binary_remote_addr`)
- **Limit:** 10 requests/minute per IP
- **Burst:** 5 extra requests in a burst, no delay (`nodelay`) — absorbs double-clicks/accidental refresh without penalizing the user
- **Response when exceeded:** HTTP 503 (nginx's native behavior)
- **`/api/` location removed:** it was misaligned with the backend (which doesn't use an `/api` prefix) and unused — cleaned up to avoid future confusion

**Tested with:**
```bash
for i in {1..20}; do
  curl -k -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" \
    -X POST https://localhost/auth/login \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"wrong"}'
done
```
Result: the first ~6 requests go through, the rest are rejected with 503 — confirms the expected behavior (rate + burst).

## 2. Rate limit by account (backend + Redis)

**Why in the backend, not nginx:** identifying "this attempt is for account X" requires reading the body (JSON) of the POST request — nginx, without extra modules, doesn't parse JSON. Only the backend "understands" the request content.

**Why Redis, not local memory:** an in-memory variable in the Node process is lost on container restart, and isn't shared across multiple backend instances (if scaled horizontally) — each instance would only see its own attempts, allowing the limit to be bypassed.

**New file:** `backend/src/rate-limiter/rate-limiter.service.ts`

```typescript
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';
import { createClient } from 'redis';

@Injectable()
export class RateLimiterService implements OnModuleInit {
  private client = createClient({ url: process.env.REDIS_URL });

  async onModuleInit() {
    await this.client.connect();
  }

  async checkLimit(key: string, maxAttempts: number, windowSeconds: number): Promise<boolean> {
    const attempts = await this.client.incr(key);

    if (attempts === 1) {
      await this.client.expire(key, windowSeconds);
    }

    return attempts <= maxAttempts;
  }

  async resetLimit(key: string): Promise<void> {
    await this.client.del(key);
  }
}
```

- **`INCR`** is atomic — avoids a race condition on simultaneous requests (reading, incrementing, and writing separately would let two parallel attempts collapse into a single count)
- **`EXPIRE`** is only set on the 1st attempt (`attempts === 1`) — if it were reset on every attempt, the lockout would never actually expire
- **Generic and reusable** — the service knows nothing about "login"; it can be used to limit other actions (creating posts, trades, etc.) just by calling `checkLimit` with a different `key`/limits

**Integration in `backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts`:**

```typescript
async login(dto: LoginDto) {
  const key = "login_attempts:" + dto.email;
  const allowed = await this.rateLimiter.checkLimit(key, 5, 1800);
  if (!allowed) {
    throw new UnauthorizedException('Invalid email or password');
  }

  // ... normal validation (findUnique, bcrypt.compare) ...

  await this.rateLimiter.resetLimit(key);
  // ... generate and return the token ...
}
```

- **Checked before the database query** — avoids spending a Postgres connection on already-blocked attempts (protects the Postgres connection pool, a finite resource)
- **5 failed attempts / 30 minutes** (1800s) — industry reference values; balances not annoying distracted users against not leaving an attacker too much room
- **Identical error message** in all cases ("account doesn't exist", "wrong password", "blocked due to attempts") — avoids confirming to an attacker whether the account exists or whether it's being rate-limited
- **Reset on success** — a correct login clears the failure history; old errors don't penalize forever

**Registered in `backend/src/auth/auth.module.ts`:** `RateLimiterService` added to `providers`.

## Bug found during testing (unrelated to rate limiting)

While testing the IP rate limit, `/auth/login` was returning **HTTP 500** even for a single isolated request, instead of the expected 401 for invalid credentials. Reported to the backend teammate — root cause not yet confirmed fixed; a later test run no longer hit the 500, but this should still be verified explicitly via backend logs (`docker logs backend`).

## Testing after implementation

1. **By IP:** repeat the `curl` loop above — confirm 503 after the burst.
2. **By account:** 6 consecutive failed attempts for the same email (from different origins/IPs, or with the IP limit temporarily disabled) — confirm 401 with the generic message on the 6th.
3. **Reset:** 2-3 consecutive failures, then a successful login — confirm you get the full 5 attempts back (no "inherited" history).

## Known simplifications / future work

- Vault runs in `-dev` mode (no persistence, no real seal/unseal) — acceptable for the scope of the project, but documented as a known simplification.
- Current monitoring is metrics-only (Prometheus/Grafana); there's no centralized log aggregation (e.g. Loki) — a gap to cover if time allows.
- No rate limiting yet on the remaining endpoints (forum, trades) — `RateLimiterService` is already built to be reused once those routes exist.
